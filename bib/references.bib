abstract = {The cooperation of trucks and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has become a new delivery method in the area of logistics and transportation. In this form of cooperation, the trucks are not only able to provide services to the customers, but also serve as a ‘launch pad’ for the drones, in which the drones can be launched to service a customer and then recovered at the rendezvous node. This study intends to explore this cooperation by developing a model for the vehicle routing problem with drones that considers the presence of customer time windows (VRPTWD). A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is presented to minimize the total travelling costs. Then, a simple yet effective variable neighborhood search (VNS) procedure with a novel solution representation is proposed as a solver. The numerical results indicate the ability of the proposed VNS to solve the VRPTWD, as well as the improvement of delivery performance using drones.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present an efficient variable neighborhood search heuristic for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. The objective is to design least cost routes for a fleet of identically capacitated vehicles to service geographically scattered customers with known demands. The variable neighborhood search procedure is used to guide a set of standard improvement heuristics. In addition, a strategy reminiscent of the guided local search metaheuristic is used to help escape local minima. The developed solution method is specifically aimed at solving very large scale real-life vehicle routing problems. To speed up the method and cut down memory usage, new implementation concepts are used. Computational experiments on 32 existing large scale benchmarks, as well as on 20 new very large scale problem instances, demonstrate that the proposed method is fast, competitive and able to find high-quality solutions for problem instances with up to 20,000 customers within reasonable CPU times.}

abstract = {Once limited to the military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles are now poised to gain widespread adoption in the commercial sector. One such application is to deploy these aircraft, also known as drones, for last-mile delivery in logistics operations. While significant research efforts are underway to improve the technology required to enable delivery by drone, less attention has been focused on the operational challenges associated with leveraging this technology. This paper provides two mathematical programming models aimed at optimal routing and scheduling of unmanned aircraft, and delivery trucks, in this new paradigm of parcel delivery. In particular, a unique variant of the classical vehicle routing problem is introduced, motivated by a scenario in which an unmanned aerial vehicle works in collaboration with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels. We present mixed integer linear programming formulations for two delivery-by-drone problems, along with two simple, yet effective, heuristic solution approaches to solve problems of practical size. Solutions to these problems will facilitate the adoption of unmanned aircraft for last-mile delivery. Such a delivery system is expected to provide faster receipt of customer orders at less cost to the distributor and with reduced environmental impacts. A numerical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the heuristics and investigates the tradeoffs between using drones with faster flight speeds versus longer endurance.}

  abstract={ The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) has been subject to intense research efforts for more than sixty years. Yet, significant algorithmic improvements are still being made. The most competitive heuristic solution algorithms of today utilize, and often combine, strategies and elements from evolutionary algorithms, local search, and ruin-and-recreate based large neighborhood search. In this paper we propose a new hybrid metaheuristic for the CVRP, where the education phase of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) algorithm proposed by (Vidal Hybrid Genetic Search for the CVRP: Open-Source Implementation and SWAP* Neighborhood 2020) is extended by applying large neighborhood search (LNS). By performing a series of computational experiments, we attempt to answer the following research questions: 1) Is it possible to gain performance by adding LNS as a component in the education phase of HGS? 2) How does the addition of LNS change the relative importance of the local search neighborhoods of HGS? 3) What is the effect of devoting computational efforts to the creation of an elite solution in the initial population of HGS? Through a set of computational experiments we answer these research questions, while at the same time obtaining a good configuration of global parameter settings for the proposed heuristic. Testing the heuristic on benchmark instances from the literature with limited computing time, it outperforms existing algorithms, both in terms of the final gap and the primal integral.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed—through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features—are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones—the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {Drones are currently seen as a viable way of improving the distribution of parcels in urban and rural environments, while working in coordination with traditional vehicles, such as trucks. In this paper, we consider the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem, where a set of customers requiring a delivery is split between a truck and a fleet of drones, with the aim of minimizing the total time required to serve all the customers. We propose a constraint programming model for the problem, discuss its implementation and present the results of an experimental program on the instances previously cited in the literature to validate exact and heuristic algorithms. We were able to decrease the cost (the time required to serve customers) for some of the instances and, for the first time, to provide a demonstrated optimal solution for all the instances considered. These results show that constraint programming can be a very effective tool for attacking optimization problems with traveling salesman components, such as the one discussed.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (EVRPD), the first VRP combining electric ground vehicles (EVs) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, in order to deliver packages to customers. The problem’s objective is to minimize the total energy consumption, focusing on the main non-constant and controllable factor of energy consumption on a delivery vehicle, the payload weight. The problem considers same-sized packages, belonging to different weight classes. EVs serve as motherships, from which drones are deployed to deliver the packages. Drones can carry multiple packages, up to a certain weight limit and their range is depended on their payload weight. For solving the EVRPD, four algorithms of the Ant Colony Optimization framework are implemented, two versions of the Ant Colony System and the Min–Max Ant System. A Variable Neighborhood Descent algorithm is utilized in all variants as a local search procedure. Instances for the EVRPD are created based on the two-echelon VRP literature and are used to test the proposed algorithms. Their computational results are compared and discussed. Practical, real-life scenarios of the EVRPD application are also presented and solved.}

We present a set of matheuristic methods for the problem. The new approaches are validated via an experimental campaign on two sets of benchmarks available in the literature. It is shown that the approaches we propose perform very well on small/medium size instances. Solving a mixed integer linear programming model to optimality leads to the first optimality proof for all the instances with 20 customers considered, while the heuristics are shown to be fast and effective on the same dataset. When considering larger instances with 48 to 229 customers, the results are competitive with state-of-the-art methods and lead to 28 new best known solutions out of the 90 instances considered}
